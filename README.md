# GamesAppli

Welcome to my first Java project. This is a two games application I did as project in order to get a specialized Java degree.
 
  
  

### How to play it?

To execute the application I recommend you tu use [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

In Eclpse you have to:

```
File > Import > Git > Projects from Git > Clone URI
```

Clone the repository!

```

Enjoy it!
